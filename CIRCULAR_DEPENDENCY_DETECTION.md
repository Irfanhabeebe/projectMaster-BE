# Circular Dependency Detection for Project Steps

## Overview

Circular dependency detection prevents the creation of invalid workflow cycles when adding adhoc steps. The validation ensures that adding new dependencies won't create a circular reference where Step A → Step B → Step C → Step A.

## Implementation

### When Validation Occurs

The circular dependency check is performed **after the step is created** but **before any dependencies are saved** to the database. This allows us to safely rollback if a circular dependency is detected.

### Scope

As per the requirement, **dependency checks are confined to the task level**:
- Only steps within the same `project_task_id` are considered
- Cross-task dependencies are not checked (they don't create issues within task scope)

### Algorithm

The implementation uses a simple **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm:

1. **Build Dependency Graph**: Collect all existing dependencies for steps in the same task
2. **Check "Depends On" Relationships**: For each new dependency where new step depends on existing step, check if existing step has a path back to new step
3. **Check "Dependent" Relationships**: For each new dependency where existing step depends on new step, check if new step has a path back to existing step
4. **Throw Error**: If any circular path is detected, throw `ProjectMasterException`

## Example Scenario

### Scenario: Creating Circular Dependency

**Existing Steps in Task:**
- Step A (id: a1)
- Step B (id: b1)

**Existing Dependencies:**
- B depends on A (A → B)

**Creating New Step C with:**
```json
{
  "name": "Step C",
  "dependsOn": [
    {
      "entityType": "STEP",
      "entityId": "b1"  // C depends on B
    }
  ],
  "dependents": [
    {
      "entityType": "STEP",
      "entityId": "a1"  // A depends on C
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:**
This would create: A → C → B, but also C → A (from dependents)
Combined with existing A → B, we'd have: **A → C → A** (circular!)

**Error Thrown:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Circular dependency detected: Adding this dependency would create a cycle in the workflow"
}
```

## Code Flow

### 1. Step Creation
```java
ProjectStep savedStep = projectStepRepository.save(adhocStep);
```

### 2. Circular Dependency Validation
```java
validateNoCircularDependencies(savedStep, request.getDependsOn(), request.getDependents(), project.getId());
```

### 3. Dependency Graph Building
```java
// Build graph of existing dependencies
Map<UUID, Set<UUID>> dependencyGraph = new HashMap<>();
for (ProjectDependency dep : existingDependencies) {
    dependencyGraph.computeIfAbsent(dep.getDependentEntityId(), k -> new HashSet<>())
            .add(dep.getDependsOnEntityId());
}
```

### 4. Path Detection Using DFS
```java
private boolean hasPath(Map<UUID, Set<UUID>> graph, UUID from, UUID to) {
    Set<UUID> visited = new HashSet<>();
    return dfs(graph, from, to, visited);
}

private boolean dfs(Map<UUID, Set<UUID>> graph, UUID current, UUID target, Set<UUID> visited) {
    if (current.equals(target)) return true;
    if (visited.contains(current)) return false;
    
    visited.add(current);
    
    Set<UUID> dependencies = graph.get(current);
    if (dependencies != null) {
        for (UUID next : dependencies) {
            if (dfs(graph, next, target, visited)) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Validation Rules

### For "Depends On" Dependencies
When creating: `newStep depends on existingStep`
- Check if: `existingStep` has any path back to `newStep`
- If yes → Circular dependency detected ❌

### For "Dependents" Dependencies
When creating: `existingStep depends on newStep`
- Check if: `newStep` has any path back to `existingStep`
- If yes → Circular dependency detected ❌

## Error Response

### HTTP Response
```
Status: 400 Bad Request
```

### Response Body
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Circular dependency detected: Adding this dependency would create a cycle in the workflow"
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Building**: O(D) where D = number of existing dependencies
- **Path Detection**: O(V + E) where V = vertices (steps), E = edges (dependencies)
- **Overall**: O(D + V + E) per dependency check

### Space Complexity
- O(V) for visited set
- O(E) for dependency graph
- **Overall**: O(V + E)

### Optimization
Since checks are **confined to task scope**, the graph size is typically small:
- Average task has 5-15 steps
- Each step has 1-3 dependencies
- Total checks complete in milliseconds

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Simple Circular Dependency ❌
```
Existing: A → B
Creating: C with dependencies:
  - C depends on B
  - A depends on C
Result: A → C → B and C → A (circular!)
Error: Should throw exception
```

### Test Case 2: Valid Chain ✅
```
Existing: A → B
Creating: C with dependencies:
  - C depends on B
Result: A → B → C (valid chain)
Success: Should create successfully
```

### Test Case 3: Multiple Dependencies ❌
```
Existing: A → B, B → C
Creating: D with dependencies:
  - D depends on C
  - A depends on D
Result: A → D → C but A → B → C already exists (circular!)
Error: Should throw exception
```

### Test Case 4: Self-Dependency ❌
```
Creating: C with dependencies:
  - C depends on C
Result: C → C (self-loop)
Error: Should throw exception
```

### Test Case 5: No Dependencies ✅
```
Creating: C with no dependencies
Result: Standalone step
Success: Should create successfully
```

## Integration with Transaction Management

The validation is performed within the `@Transactional` method. If a circular dependency is detected:

1. Exception is thrown
2. Transaction is rolled back
3. The newly created step is removed
4. No dependencies are created
5. Database remains in consistent state

## Logging

### Debug Log (Success)
```
Circular dependency validation passed for new step {stepId}
```

### No Error Log (Failure)
Error is thrown as exception, logged by exception handler at controller level

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Detailed Error Messages**
   - Show the actual circular path: "A → C → B → A"
   - Help users understand which dependency causes the issue

2. **Cross-Task Dependency Checks**
   - If needed in future, extend to check across tasks
   - Currently not required as per business rules

3. **Dependency Suggestions**
   - Suggest valid dependencies that won't create circles
   - AI-powered dependency recommendations

4. **Visualization**
   - Show dependency graph in UI
   - Highlight potential circular dependencies before submission

5. **Batch Validation**
   - When creating multiple steps, validate entire batch
   - Prevent partial creation

## API Impact

### No Breaking Changes
- Existing valid requests continue to work
- Only invalid circular dependencies are rejected
- Error response follows existing error format

### User Experience
- Clear error message explains the issue
- Users can adjust dependencies and retry
- Prevents workflow execution failures

## Conclusion

The circular dependency detection provides robust validation that:
- ✅ Prevents invalid workflow cycles
- ✅ Uses efficient DFS algorithm
- ✅ Confined to task scope (as required)
- ✅ Provides clear error messages
- ✅ Maintains transaction consistency
- ✅ Has minimal performance impact
- ✅ No breaking changes to API

This ensures workflow integrity and prevents execution deadlocks caused by circular dependencies.
